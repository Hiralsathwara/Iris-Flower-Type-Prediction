# Iris-Flower-Type-Prediction

This is a simple Streamlit-based web app that uses a Logistic Regression model to classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The app loads the Iris dataset, trains a Logistic Regression model, and allows users to input values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width using sliders. Based on the input, it predicts the flower species and displays the result along with the model's accuracy.

<h5>This is for beginners who want to create a small machine learning model with a user interface (UI).</h5>
